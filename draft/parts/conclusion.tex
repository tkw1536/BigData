In this paper we have talked about caching and how it is used by YouTube in particular. We have discussed how caching enables the watching of Videos on the internet by downloading the video onto the hard disk of the local computer. We have mentioned how techniques like distributed caching or the concept of CDNs can increase this process to make it faster. Even though this brings a lot of advantages we have also seen how this can have negative side effects and other social implications. 

Clearly the problem of Big Data and its use in caching cannot be solved by technical solutions alone. Social impacts need to be considered and, like almost every other use of Big Data, this involves taking privacy issues into account. In general (Big) Data collection always has good and bad effects. The disadvantages mostly come from privacy issues whereas the advantages mostly come from the fact that it can make technical solutions more efficient. Because of this it can make sense to offer options to the end-user so that they can decide if the want a better experience in their service or a better protection of their privacy.
