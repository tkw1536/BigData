\section{Background}
\section{Motivation}
Caching is very important when it comes to streaming videos online. According to an article \cite{OnlineVideoBandwagon}, in 2007, 50\% traffic came from several thousand sites and by 2009, 50\% traffic came from 150 sites. Furthermore, by 2013, the 50\% of all internet traffic came form 35 or more sites. From this we can see that the traffic of websites that are popular is being aggravated. A lot of this increase in traffic to a smaller number of websites is due to online video streaming.

Before 2012, video streaming was done using using Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP)-based servers. This requires a streaming server and a near-continuous connection between the server and player. Requiring a streaming server can increase implementation cost, while RTMP-based packets can be blocked by firewalls. In 2012, this was replaced by an (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) HTTP-based servers known as MPEG DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP).  By using this technology, the servers were able to use HTTP-Caching. This latter capability should both decrease total bandwidth costs associated with delivering the video, since more data can be served from web-based caches rather than the origin server, and improve quality of service, since cached data is generally closer to the viewer and more easily retrievable.
