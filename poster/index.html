            <h4>What is Caching?</h4>

            <span>
            <ul>
              <li>Caching is a method to store data in a so-called cache. </li>
              <li>It helps improve the efficiency of the computer and the overall efficiency of the task at hand.</li>
              <li>Caching involves pre-loading data into a certain area of memory known as a “buffer” in the local machine. </li>
              <li>YouTube was using RTMP-based Dynamic Streaming. </li>
              <li>If a user had a relatively slow connection, this would not allow them to view the video as smoothly as one would want. </li>
              <li>They could pause the video and view it later when the whole video had buffered to the local storage of the browser. </li>
              <li>YouTube was able to exploit this feature resulting in higher resolution videos being available to the user in a more efficient manner. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <span>
            	<h5>Distributed Caching</h5>
            	<ul>
            		<li>A distributed cache may span multiple servers so that it can grow in size and in transactional capacity</li>
            		<li>With distributed cache, a website can respond to more requests simultaneously. </li>
            		<li>The distributed cached data remain accessible to every server that runs the application when servers are added or removed.</li>
            	</ul>
            </span>
            <span>

            </span>
            <span>
            	<h5>Content Delivery Network</h5>
            	<ul>
            		<li>A <i>Content Delivery Network</i>(CDN) is a system of distributed network that delivers web contents to a user based on the geographic locations of the user</li>
            		<li>Servers nearest to the website visitor will respond to its request, the CDN can reduce traffic on the primary network</li>
            	</ul>
            </span>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
            <span>
              <h5>Technical Side effects</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>There is a lot of overhead to check if a video is already in the cache</li>
                <li>The video might have changed in the meanwhile. </li>
                <li>Old videos or videos the user never really watched could end up in the cache and take up disk space. </li>
                <li>The provider no longer has complete control over what happens with the videos. </li>
              </ul>
            </span>
            <span>
              <h5>Social Implications</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Videos could be predicted and pre-loaded when the user is not interested in them. </li>
                <li>Users might not want to have their viewing history recorded. </li>
                <li>YouTube sells the users (anonymized) data to advertisers. </li>
              </ul>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <span>
              <ul>
                <li>It is important that users can a watch video (on services like YouTube) fluently. This uses caching which is a method to store data in a cache. </li>
                <li>A more specific kind of caching - buffering - consists of preloading data into a certain area of memory of local machine. </li>
                <li>
                  Two techniques to deliver web contents effectively are Distributed Caching and Content Delivery Networks.

                </li>
                <li>
                  The disadvantages of caching is that the cache is difficult to maintain.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Social implications of caching - Users privacy: Users viewing history might be used without their consent.
